## TDD Assignment

Create a repo named: `bc-9-tdd`

Write a (_variadic_) function `super_sum()` that takes
in any number of numbers (or list of numbers) and sums them up.

Example:
```python
super_sum(10, 5, 6, 9) => 30
super_sum([10, 5], 5) => 20
super_sum([5, 6], [4, 5], 10) => 30
```

**Write at least 5 test cases for your function, before implementing:**

1. Write the tests, then do a commit and push
2. Write the implementation of your function
